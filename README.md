# Guilded Dice Bot

 
Hello there! I am a dice rolling bot. ðŸŽ²

I can roll dice for you!  Just let me know which dice to roll by using `!d` followed by the number of sides the dice should have.

### Here are some common commands you can use:
- `!d?` or `!dhelp` to list common commands
- `!d6` - roll a 6 sided dice
- `!d20` - roll a 20 sided dice
- `!d100` - roll a 100 sided dice
- `!3d6` - roll three 6 sided dice (I can only roll up to 10 dice at a time)

### Dev

If you want to clone and use this respository make sure you change the `token` constant in `index.js` to be your Guilded bot's token or use an environment variable to refer to it.
